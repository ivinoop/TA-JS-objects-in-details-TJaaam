In this assignment you have to add methods to the `prototype` of Array. Array is a constructor function and all the array methods like `map`, `forEach` and `filter` etc comes from `Array.prototype`. So when you add a new method in `Array.prototype` the method gets added to all the instance of the array.

1. Create a function named `myMap` and add the method to `Array.prototype`. `myMap` will behave similar to how the `Array.map` works. To test the implementation use the code below.

**You should know once you add an extra method to Array.prototype and refresh the page. The method you added will be gone.**

2. Add a method named `myFilter` to Array.prototype. myFilter should behave similar to Array.filter. After adding the function test it using the code below.

3. Add a method named `shuffle` to Array.prototype. Using the method shuffle will return a new array and in the new array the index of the elements will be shuffled (randomly reorders).

4. Add a method named `unique` to Array.prototype. Using the method will return a new array and it should only contain unique elements in the array. Unique means no element should come multiple times.

5. Add a method named `intersection` to Array.prototype. The method intersection will accept an array and returns a new array that will contain only element that is common in both the array.

6. Add a method named `chunk` to Array.prototype. The method chunk will accept one parameter `length` and split the array into groups the length of size. If array can't be split evenly, the final chunk will be the remaining elements. `length` should default to 1.
